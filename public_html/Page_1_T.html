        <p1>-The Internet started in the 1960s as a way for government researchers to share information.</p1>
        <p2>-Computers in the '60s were large and immobile and in order to make use of information stored in any one computer, one had to either travel to the site of the computer or have magnetic computer tapes sent through the conventional postal system.</p2>-The Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite spurred the U.S. Defense Department to consider ways information could still be disseminated even after a nuclear attack.</p3>
          <p3>-This eventually led to the formation of the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), the network that ultimately evolved into what we now know as the Internet.</p3>

            <p1>-The internet as we know it did not exist until much later, but internet history started much in 1960s.</p1>
            <p2>-In 1962, MIT computer scientist J.C.R. Licklider came up with the idea for a global computer network. He later shared his idea with colleagues at the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).
                Licklider was instrumental in conceiving, funding and managing the research that led to modern personal computers and the Internet.</p2>

            <p1>-Work by Leonard Kleinrock and Lawrence G. Roberts on packet-switching theory pioneers the way to the world’s first wide-area computer network.</p1><br>
            <p2>-Roberts later published a plan for the ARPANET, an ARPA-funded computer network that became a reality in 1969.</p2><br>
            <p3>-Over the following years, the ARPANET grew.Kleinrock published research on the theory and application of queuing theory to computer networks.</p3><br>
            <p4>-Roberts managed its implementation and contracted with Leonard Kleinrock in 1968 to carry out mathematical modelling of the packet-switched network's performance.</p4><br>
            <p5>-Roberts engaged Howard Frank to consult on the topological design of the network.</p5><br>
            <p6>-Frank made recommendations to increase throughput and reduce costs in a scaled-up network.</p6>
