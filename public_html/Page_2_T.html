            <p1>1973,Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf collaborated to develop a protocol that linked multiple networks together.</p1>
            <p2>This later became the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), a technology that linked multiple networks together.</p2>
            <p3>If one network was brought down, the others did not collapse.</p3>

            <p1>While working at Xerox, Robert Metcalfe developed a system using cables that allowed for transfer of more data over a network<p1>
            <p2>He named this system Alto Aloha, but later it wasn named as Ethernet.</p2>
            <p3>Over the next few years, Ted Nelson proposed hypertext to organize network information, and Unix became popular for TCP/IP networks.</p3>
            <p4>Dave Farber of the University of Delaware revealed a project to build an inexpensive network using dial-up phone lines.</p4>
            <p5>In 1982, the PhoneNet system was established and got connected to ARPANET and the first commercial network, Telenet.</p5>

            <p1>Ray Tomlinson came up with the idea while working for ARPANET.</p1>
                <p2>The government-funded research project that eventually became the internet.</p2>
                <p3>Tomlinson created a program that gave users the ability to send messages between connected computers on the ARPANET system.</p3>
                <p4>He put the two programs together, modified the code a little bit and thus the email program was born.</p4>
                <p5>He also gave the world the new icon for the information age, the “@” sign which was an obvious choice as it meant that there is some user at some location.</p5>
                <p6>The term email was coined several years later. The email became the killer app for ARPANET.</p6>
